# Solar-Stewart-Tracker
Our idea is a two-axis solar tracking system using a Stewart-platform mechanism, where a camera is used to estimate the sun’s position and the platform adjusts the panel orientation in real time. The focus would be on real-time vision processing, control, and task scheduling.
